I found a dataset that covered 30 years' worth of passenger and flight information. Using pandas, I cleaned it, analyzed it, added features, merged it with external data, used Random Forest to identify the important features, and then built a Polynomial Regression model that predicts the number of monthly passengers based on a few varying features.
